# Robot Framework Tests
This is used for storing robot framework test scripts. These test scripts will be automatically deployed through Jenkins (Continuous Delivery).

Jenkins is a continuous integration and continuous delivery application. It builds and tests software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by providing powerful ways to define your build pipelines and integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.
